# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my github profile.
## Vinícius Barbosa

I am 20 years old, from Patos/PB, and a Computer Science student. In 2022, I ventured into this course, and for some reason, I "fell in love" with it. I say this because I get more frustrated programming than I do happy, but when the final result comes together, there's always a satisfying feeling.
